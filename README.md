# TW5-toc_counting
a plugin for TW5. [Go to demo and download](https://hchaase.github.io/TW5-toc_counting/). 

Sometimes TW can feel like a black box, I made this plugin to get a better feel of my table of contents / index tiddlers at a glance.

The TOC counting plugin adds a count of child tiddlers to the right of each entry in the TOC(s). No count will be shown if there isn't any child tiddlers (e.g. no 0).
